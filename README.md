This Code is the solution of Hackerrank Left Array Rotation Problem.

Problem:

A left rotation operation on an array shifts each of the array's elements  unit to the left. For example, if  left rotations are performed on array [1,2,3,4,5] , then the array would become [5,4,3,1,2].

Given an array  of  integers and a number, , perform  left rotations on the array. Return the updated array to be printed as a single line of space-separated integers.

Function Description

Complete the function rotLeft in the editor below. It should return the resulting array of integers.

rotLeft has the following parameter(s):

An array a of integers .
An integer d, the number of rotations.
Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers n and d, the size of a and the number of left rotations you must perform.
The second line contains n space-separated integers a[i] .
